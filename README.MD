My plan here is to make an interactive character sheet for the ttrpg Masks, a game that uses the Powered by the Apocalypse game engine. I am still learning how to code (I only started coding on 17 September, 2021), so this will be a project made in stages as I learn.

## Stage 1 - DONE

   **DONE** - *create the form for the player to enter their character's name character's playbook* 
   
   **DONE** - *take those form entries and transform it into a character sheet*

## Stage 2 - DONE

   **DONE** - *add adjustment buttons for each stat*
   
   **DONE** - *Make clicking on the adjustment buttons add or subtract from the stat modifiers* 
   
   **DONE** - *add "dice rolling" capability, adding the stat modifiers to the roller*
   
   **DONE** - *button to clear the dice roller* 

## Stage 3.0 DONE

  **DONE** - *add Potential (aka experience) counter*
  **DONE** - *add condition markers check boxes*
  **DONE** - *add Look description boxes*

###  Stage 3.1
  - factor in condition markers to dice rolls

## Stage 4

  - add in ability to save the character sheet and come back to it
  - cause the character creator form to disappear on button clicking

## Stage 5

  - add tab 'sheets' to move between stats and moves
