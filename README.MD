My plan here is to make an interactive character sheet for the ttrpg Masks, a game that uses the Powered by the Apocalypse game engine. I am still learning how to code (I only started coding on 17 September, 2021), so this will be a project made in stages as I learn.

## Stage 1

   ~~create the form for the player to enter their * character's name * character's playbook * character's starting Stats~~
    ~~take those form entries and transform it into a character sheet~~

## Stage 2

		~~ add adjustment buttons for each stat ~~
		~~	make clicking on the adjustment buttons add or subtract from the stat modifiers~~

    ~~ add "dice rolling" capability, adding the stat modifiers to the roller ~~

		~~button to clear the dice roller~~

## Stage 3.0

    add Potential (aka experience) counter

    add condition markers check boxes

    add Look description boxes

  ###  Stage 3.1
        factor in condition markers to dice rolls

## Stage 4

    add in ability to save the character sheet and come back to it

		cause the character creator form to disappear on button clicking

## Stage 5

	add tab 'sheets' to move between stats and moves
